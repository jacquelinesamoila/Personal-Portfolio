            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hey there! I'm Jacqueline Samoila, a 10th-grade high school student bursting with energy and a love for various interests. Academically, I'm into the world of numbers and elements, finding joy in subjects like maths and chemistry.

                When I'm not hitting the books, you can catch me on the volleyball court, where I channel my passion for sports. The teamwork and adrenaline rush make it an exciting part of my high school journey.
                
                But that's not allâ€”I'm a dancer, too. Dancing is my creative outlet, and it's where I can let loose and showcase my rhythm and style. When I'm not moving to the beat, I'm expressing myself on paper through drawing, exploring different forms of art.
                
                In my downtime, I love to unwind with a mix of entertainment. Whether it's diving into the virtual world through video games, getting lost in a Netflix series, or discovering new tunes, I find joy in a variety of recreational activities.
                
                So, whether I'm acing my classes, spiking a volleyball, grooving on the dance floor, putting pencil to paper, or just chilling with some entertainment, my high school experience is all about embracing the diverse facets of life.</p>
